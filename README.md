# My AutoHotkey

My personal “AutoHotkey” folder in my “Documents” folder.

Clone this via `git clone --recurse-submodules` because it currently uses some submodules.

# Requirements

- AutoHotkey v2.0
- Windows 10, 64-bit
- A *user* environment variable named `AHK_USER` that points to the current user's AutoHotkey directory (e.g. `C:\Users\MyName\Documents\AutoHotkey` or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\AutoHotkey`)
	- Needed by some `*.lnk` files in the repo.
- This repo must exist as the `AHK_USER` directory (i.e., its repo directory name should also be `AutoHotkey`)
