# AutoHotkey

My personal “AutoHotkey” folder in my “Documents” folder.

Clone this via `git clone --recurse-submodules` because it currently uses some submodules.

# Requirements

1. Windows 10, 8 or 7
2. The OS type must be x64
3. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of AutoHotkey EXEs including their unicode and UIA counterparts are installed.
4. There must be an `AHK_HOME` system environment variable pointing to the AutoHotkey installation directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey`)
5. `AHK_HOME` must be added to the system `PATH`
6. There must be an `AHK_USER` user environment variable pointing to current user's AutoHotkey directory (e.g. `C:\Users\MyName\Documents\AutoHotkey`)
7. This repo must exist as the `AHK_USER` directory (i.e., it's repo directory name should also be `AutoHotkey`)
